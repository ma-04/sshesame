# sshesame

An easy to set up and use SSH honeypot, a fake SSH server that lets anyone in and logs their activity

`sshesame` accepts and logs SSH connections and activity (channels, requests), without doing anything on the host (e.g. executing commands, making network requests).

## Installation and usage
> [!WARNING]
> The [`sshesame` package](https://packages.debian.org/stable/sshesame) in the official Debian (and derivatives) repositories may be (probably is) outdated.

### From source

```
git clone https://github.com/jaksi/sshesame.git
cd sshesame
go build
```

### GitHub releases

Linux, macOS and Windows binaries for several architectures are built and released automatically and are available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/jaksi/sshesame/releases).

### Usage

```
$ sshesame -h
Usage of sshesame:
  -config string
    	optional config file
  -data_dir string
    	data directory to store automatically generated host keys in (default "...")
```

Debug and error logs are written to standard error. Activity logs by default are written to standard out, unless the `logging.file` config option is set.

### Docker

Images for amd64, arm64 and armv7 are built and published automatically and are available on the [Packages page](https://github.com/jaksi/sshesame/pkgs/container/sshesame).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using a custom config file, set `server.listen_address` to listen on all interfaces (e.g. to `0.0.0.0:2022`) to ensure Docker port forwarding works.

#### CLI

```
docker run -it --rm\
  -p 127.0.0.1:2022:2022\
  -v sshesame-data:/data\
  [-v $PWD/sshesame.yaml:/config.yaml]\
  ghcr.io/jaksi/sshesame
```

#### Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/jaksi/sshesame
#COPY sshesame.yaml /config.yaml
```

#### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  sshesame:
    image: ghcr.io/jaksi/sshesame
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:2022:2022"
    volumes:
      - sshesame-data:/data
      #- ./sshesame.yaml:/config.yaml
volumes:
  sshesame-data: {}
```

### systemd

```desktop
[Unit]
Description=SSH honeypot
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/sshesame #-config /path/to/sshesame.yaml
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```


### Configuration

A configuration file can optionally be passed using the `-config` flag.
Without specifying one, sane defaults will be used and an RSA, ECDSA and Ed25519 host key will be generated and stored in the directory specified in the `-data_dir` flag.

A [sample configuration file](sshesame.yaml) with default settings and explanations for all configuration options is included.  
A [minimal configuration file](openssh.yaml) which tries to mimic an OpenSSH server is also included.
